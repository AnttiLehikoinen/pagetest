# EMDtool briefly

EMDtool is an Electric Motor Design toolbox for Matlab. It features full-functionality 2D Finite Element Analysis with nonlinearity, circuit connections, and motion, with under-development 3D capacity as well.

EMDtool is generally regarded as _fast_ compared to e.g. [FEMM](https://www.femm.info/wiki/HomePage) or Maxwell.

Finally, the industrial licenses of EMDtool are largely [source-available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software), making it easy for you to extend and modify it to your organization's needs. This 
makes EMDtool the ideal choice for medium-sized enterprises that would greatly benefit from a custom-inhouse software toolkit, but don't have the resources to dedicate an entire team (or department )to building and 
maintaining one.
